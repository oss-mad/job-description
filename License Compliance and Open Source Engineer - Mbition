Interact with the wider Open Source community to establish a network of collaborators and engage with innovation drivers. MBition aims to support and facilitate upstream communities that develop functionality significant to our products.
Last but not least, the Open Source Team helps to shape the whole organization adopt open innovation, remote work and to adopt and foster community spirit. This is why Open Source community experience is an important expectation towards any candidate.
